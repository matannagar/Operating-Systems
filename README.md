# Operating-Systems

**Objectives of the module:** 
<br>Provide the necessary theoretical and practical knowledge in major
approaches used in various designs of operating systems.<br>
The course provides an introduction to modern operating systems. <br>Various aspects of operating
systems are reviewed and discussed, including such basic concepts as processes, scheduling,
synchronization, memory management, etc. <br>The course emphasizes practical study of operating
systems and provides students with the opportunity for hands-on work mostly on the LINUX
operating system complementing the theoretical background.
